# RL project
## Structure
The project is subdivided in 3 main folders, 2 of which ([Frozenlake_example](https://github.com/ChristianCella/PID-accelerated-VI---RL-project/tree/main/Frozenlake_example) and [src](https://github.com/ChristianCella/PID-accelerated-VI---RL-project/tree/main/src)) are not 'packages' (no '__init__.py') and they are not strictly related to the project; more in detail:
- [Frozenlake_example](https://github.com/ChristianCella/PID-accelerated-VI---RL-project/tree/main/Frozenlake_example), is a folder conatining a very simple testbed for Reinforcement Learning using a tabular approach (it is subdivided into a training phase and a post-training phase);
- [src](https://github.com/ChristianCella/PID-accelerated-VI---RL-project/tree/main/src) is the unmodified repo of the authors, added to the project just to have all the material as close as possible in case some changes need to be made.

The third folder, called [MDPs](https://github.com/ChristianCella/PID-accelerated-VI---RL-project/tree/main/MDPs), is actually a package and contains the classes ('FiniteMDP' and 'FrozenLakeMDP', defined in [finiteMDPs.py](https://github.com/ChristianCella/PID-accelerated-VI---RL-project/blob/main/MDPs/finiteMDPs.py)), the basic functions for the four different tests (defined in [vanilla_functions.py](https://github.com/ChristianCella/PID-accelerated-VI---RL-project/blob/main/MDPs/vanilla_functions.py)), the more complex functions relying on the basic ones (defined in [tests_functions.py](https://github.com/ChristianCella/PID-accelerated-VI---RL-project/blob/main/MDPs/tests_functions.py)) and also a file named [Rootlocus_functions.py](https://github.com/ChristianCella/PID-accelerated-VI---RL-project/blob/main/MDPs/Rootlocus_functions.py) that is used in some of the more complex functions to gain insight about the eigenvalues.
The last file of the folder is [Bellman_matrix_form.py](https://github.com/ChristianCella/PID-accelerated-VI---RL-project/blob/main/MDPs/Bellman_matrix_form.py) and it implements, for the case of 'Prediction' in Dynamic Programming, the matrix form of the Bellman Expectation Equation: in Prediction, the goal is to evaluate the Value function $V^\pi$, by knowing the policy in advance. For this reason, after evaluating the matrix $P^\pi$, the Bellman equation can be deterministically solved. This file is very useful because the form of the equation written by the original authors (function called 'value_iteration, inside [vanilla_functions.py](https://github.com/ChristianCella/PID-accelerated-VI---RL-project/blob/main/MDPs/vanilla_functions.py)') is not so easy to be interpreted, and you can have a double-check on the results.

## Tests
In the paper, 4 figures are presented: each of the 4 files in the main directory of the project allow to obtain a specific set of figures.
